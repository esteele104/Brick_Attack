# Everton's Brick Attack

#Project Description: 
This project is a brick breaker game with my own twist on the way it functions and looks. It is space themed. This brick breaker game have 5 levels. To complete a level you must destroy all the bricks. Each level is harder than the previous level(debatable) with the ball getting faster and faster. At certain checkpoints during each level there will be power ups that fall from the top of the screen. Powerups include; extra lives, double ball, sticky paddle and exploding ball. For the last level, the bricks will start to descend every 25 seconds towards the user after a two minutes have passed. If the bricks get to the same Y position of the userâ€™s paddle the game is over. When the user gets down to 5 bricks left, asteroids begin to fall from the sky. If hit by an asteroid, the user explodes and loses a life and resets with the ball on the paddle. For some levels the bricks take 2 hits to break. The layout of the bricks will be different for each level.

#Getting Started:
To start playing the game simply left click and the ball will be released. If you lose all your lives or win the game, simply left click if you want to restart the game. 

#Powerup Items:
Life Item: drops from a random x position from the top of the game window, on collision with paddle gives the user an extra life and disappears, disappears on out of bounds.
Double ball item: Adds an extra ball to the game. If the user has multiple balls and one goes out of bounds, the user does not lose a life.
Sticky paddle item: causes the paddle to become sticky and holds whatever ball it touches until the user right clicks.
Exploding ball item: causes the ball to become a bomb. When the ball hits a brick there is an explosion and it explodes the bricks to the left and to the right of the initial brick that was hit.

#Score Breakdown:
Each brick that is destroyed adds 10 to the score. Picking up a powerup items adds 15 to the score. When you complete a level you get 1000 points.
